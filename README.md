**Creating API KEYS**

In order to get started with Google Maps you first need to create an API key for your new project. To create an API key navigate to the [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/maps/?&sign=0) and click GET STARTED to step through the wizard to set up your API key.
On the following screens you need to:

- Enable Google Maps API(select Maps and Places).
- Create a new project called Flutter Maps.
- Choose a billing account (donâ€™t worry there is a free tier to use).

1. Create a file => credentials.dart and put the key in : const kGoogleApiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
2. Activate the [Directions API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/google/directions-backend.googleapis.com) and put the key to the credentials file : const kGoogleApiKeyDirections = 'YOUR API KEY';

There you go, you can now run the project. Enjoy!
